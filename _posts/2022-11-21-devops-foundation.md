## Notes

### Three Ways

The key principles of DevOps

- First Way: Work always **flows** in one direction – downstream
- Second Way: Create, shorten and amplify **feedback** loops
- Third Way: Continued **experimentation**, in order to learn from mistakes, and achieve mastery

### Value-stream mapping

- material- and information-flow mapping: a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer.
- First step: Identify the key steps in the process. The organization should look at the process for which they want to create a value stream map and identify the key steps where work is done and value is added.

### shared responsibility

- shared responsibility: an aspect of DevOps culture that encourages closer collaboration. It's easy for a development team to become disinterested in the operation and maintenance of a system if it is handed over to another team to look after.

### Interact and share

organization Should consider all opportunities to interact and share.

### Kanban

- **Kanban Pull System**: A Pull System is a lean technique that is used to control the flow of work by only replacing what has been consumed. This means that the trigger for work to be done is when a customer demands for it.

### Continuous Integration

Practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

- Requires **Automated unit**, **integration** and **acceptance testing**.

### high trust organizational culture

- Cross-functional collaboration, Good information flow, Learning from failures and new ideas

### ChatOps

- **ChatOps**: a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow.

### Cultural debt

- **Cultural debt**: when we make a technical decision that borrows against the culture of the organization. Such decisions can introduce divisions between teams, deteriorate communication or even weaken the effectiveness of leadership.

### Agile Manifesto

Agile Manifesto: 4 core values followed by 12 principles.

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- working software over comprehensive documentation.
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- responding to change over following a plan.

### Golden Circle

- Golden Circle is a concept, “people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”
According to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do aspect and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.
But companies that are universally identified as unique and successful, think Apple or Google, communicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking. They start with the why and only then do they move on to talk about the how and what portions of what they do.

- **why**: represents **Purpose**, *cause* and **belief**
