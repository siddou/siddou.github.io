I am a French guy into computers since I am a kid. We had an apple II, then intel 286, 386, 486, Pentium II & Pentium III…, well still almost every two year i like to upgrade my system :p

I got a Computer Networking Telecommunications degree, CCNA, RHCSA, LPI1 and Comptia Security+.

I worked in the IT business in a Microsoft environment for more than ten years. In 2008 I began to show interest for open source, and iam lovin it! Some much to learn, never get bored with Linux!
As a sysadmin I try to raise my dev skills when I have a chance: Python, cms, php…

I love hacking phones and videos games consoles and I look forward to any new technologies.

Hope this website will be as much useful for you as it is for me.
